# Chords-and-Beats-Extraction-using-ML
This is team Bantai Log's project under Institute Technical Summer Project IIT Bombay. The team aims to build a robust Neural Network to detect chords and beats in MP3 files.

Open ChordIt->src->Chord_Sequencer.py to test our model on audio file 
Caution : Refrain from using audio files filled with silence and do not use any format other than .wav for testing purposes.
